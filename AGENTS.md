# litert-playground

pnpm monorepo for LiteRT.js browser inference. Node 22+, pnpm 11+.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `pnpm install` | Install workspace deps |
| `pnpm dev` | Start playground dev server |
| `pnpm build` | Build all projects |
| `pnpm typecheck` | Type-check every package |
| `pnpm test` | Run all package tests |
| `pnpm verify` | **CI gate**: typecheck + test + boundary + compatibility + qualification + build |
| `pnpm test:boundaries` | Enforce package dependency rules (examples → public entrypoints, inference-core independent, playground → runtime-litert) |
| `pnpm test:compatibility` | Pack/consume the supported external surface |
| `pnpm test:qualification` | Runtime qualification suite (Node env, separate vitest config) |
| `pnpm --filter <pkg> test` | Single-package tests |
| `pnpm --filter <pkg> typecheck` | Single-package typecheck |

`pnpm verify` is the authoritative pre-merge check. Do not skip boundary or qualification tests.

## Package layout

```
packages/inference-core    contracts, assets, receipts, validation (no model deps)
packages/runtime-litert    managed LiteRT runtime, backends, caching, preflight, telemetry
packages/kokoro            Kokoro TTS via kokoro-js (verified browser path)
packages/qwen3-tts         Qwen3-TTS pipeline (3 LiteRT graphs; known browser memory limitation)
packages/text-gen          LFM2.5 / Gemma 4 / Qwen3 text generation
packages/retrieval         ColBERT embeddings, late-interaction scoring
packages/encoder           Text embeddings, token classification
packages/image-embedding   Image embeddings
packages/browser-cache     Browser-side model/tensor cache
packages/video-classification  MoViNet video classification
apps/playground            React + Vite + Tailwind model lab (the consumer app)
```

Dependency flow: `inference-core → runtime-litert → model packages → playground`.
Product concepts (episodes, OBS, UI) belong in consuming apps, not shared packages.

## Conventions

- All packages: `private: true`, `type: module`, `exports: ".": "./src/index.ts"`.
  Packages ship as TypeScript source; there is no per-package build step.
- Tests co-located in `src/*.test.ts` (vitest).
- Qualification tests live in `tests/runtime-qualification/` with their own vitest config (`environment: 'node'`).
- Boundary tests in `tests/` enforce architecture invariants — keep them green.
- Vercel deploys `apps/playground/dist`; build command is `pnpm --filter playground build`.

## Workflow rules

- Stage files by explicit path; never `git add .`.
- Commit messages: conventional commits (`fix:`, `feat:`, `test:`, etc.) with a bullet body when the change spans multiple areas.
- Pre-push hook runs automatically; fix real failures, do not bypass.

## Nested agent files

Package-specific guidance lives next to the code it describes:

- `packages/runtime-litert/AGENTS.md` — backend selection, WASM probes, coordinator
- `packages/qwen3-tts/AGENTS.md` — worker lifecycle, browser memory limits
- `packages/video-classification/AGENTS.md` — transactional frame commit, SIMD probe correctness
- `packages/inference-core/AGENTS.md` — asset verification, independence constraint
- `tests/runtime-qualification/AGENTS.md` — qualification suite structure and invocation
- `apps/playground/AGENTS.md` — app entrypoint, Vercel build output
